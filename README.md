**Intro**

This single page web app was created as the first project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. 
This file contains the process by which this web app was created over the course of 4 days. 

**Pre-Planning**
After the assignment was given, I drew up a wireframe and came up with some user stories to help guide me while making the application. 

**User Stories**
## As a user, I want to be able to track my wins, so that i can see how I progress in each session
## as a casual user, I want something relaxing to look at so i can relax while I play the game
## as a new user, i want setup to be easy, so i can just get to playing the game
## as a user, i want some dynamic effect, so the program isnt boring
## as a user with a family, I want us all to have our own accounts, so that my kids dont trash my score

**Day 1**
On day 1 of the project, I put together all of the HTML and began laying out the framework for all of the functions I would be using. After that was completed, I began setting up the user authentication, and continued working on that until the end of the day. I had a few roadblocks along the way, especially with the sign-up and sign-in processes. After the issues were fixed, I was able to flow into other areas easily.

**Day 2**
On day 2 of the project, I spent my time setting up the change password and logout functionality. After that I went into hiding and showing certain elements as events happen. After that was finished, I spent the rest of the day working on all of the functions that will help the application run smoothly. This day was a lot smoother than the previous day of work

**Day 3**
On day 3 of the project, I built the game board and the game logic that would maintain the game state and check to see if a win condition is met. This was the longest day of work that I had done on this project. It took a bit of whiteboarding, and bouncing ideas off my classmates, but I was successful in finish the game logic on day 3.

**Day 4**
On the final day of the project, I spent my time styling and ironing out a few bugs. Some issues I had to fix were auto clearing form fields on a failure, clearing the game board after signing out, and showing elements after signing out

**Materials Used**
For this project I used Visual Studios Code, Google Fonts, references from stack exchange, google search for a background image, and of course spotify for working tunes. The languages used in this project are html, css, and javascript.

**Moving Forward**
Going forward I would like to implement an AI to play against as well as utilizing modals. I feel like that will make the app feel more professional and clear up some space as well as give the user clearer directions.
